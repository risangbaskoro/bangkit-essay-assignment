# Essay: Turn My Fixed Mindset into Growth Mindset

## Listing Down 3 Fixed Mindset Statements I have Towards Myself

1. Fixed mindset statement: "I'm not a creative person."
    - Why do you think you're not creative?
        - Because I've never been good at art or coming up with new ideas.
    - Why do you think you've never been good at those things?
        - Because I've always been told that some people are just naturally creative, and I'm not one of them.
    - Why do you think you believe that some people are just naturally creative?
        - Because that's what I've heard from other people, and it seems to make sense based on what I've seen.
    - Why do you think you accept that belief without questioning it?
        - Because it's easier to believe that I'm not creative than to challenge myself to try new things and risk failure.
    - Why do you think you're afraid of failure?
        - Because I worry that it will confirm my belief that I'm not creative and that I'll never be able to change.

2. Fixed mindset statement: "I can't learn a new language."
    - Why do you think you can't learn a new language?
        - Because I've tried before and I always struggled to remember the words and grammar rules.
    - Why do you think you struggled to remember them?
        - Because it was hard to keep all the different pieces of information in my head at once, and I didn't have a good system for practicing and reviewing.
    - Why do you think you didn't have a good system for practicing and reviewing?
        - Because I didn't know what strategies would be most effective, and I didn't want to waste my time on something that might not work.
    - Why do you think you're hesitant to try new strategies?
        - Because I'm afraid of putting in a lot of effort and still not making progress, and I worry that it will make me feel stupid or incompetent.
    - Why do you think you're so concerned with feeling competent?
        - Because I've always been praised for my academic abilities, and I worry that if I struggle with something, it will undermine my sense of self-worth.

3. Fixed mindset statement: "I can't change the way I think about things."
    - Why do you think you can't change your thinking patterns?
        - Because I've always had a tendency to see things in a certain way, and it's hard to break out of those habits.
    - Why do you think you developed those thinking habits in the first place?
        - Because they've helped me make sense of the world and cope with difficult situations, and they've become automatic over time.
    - Why do you think you're hesitant to question those habits now?
        - Because it's uncomfortable to challenge my own assumptions and beliefs, and it's easier to stick with what's familiar and predictable.
    - Why do you think you're afraid of feeling uncomfortable?
        - Because it's a sign that I might be wrong or that I don't know as much as I thought, and that feels threatening to my sense of identity and competence.
    - Why do you think you're so invested in your sense of identity and competence?
        - Because they're a source of security and validation, and I worry that if I change too much, I'll lose that sense of stability and confidence.


## Challenges to Turn My Fixed Mindset into Growth Mindset.

1. Embrace failure: Rather than seeing failure as a reflection of your abilities or a personal flaw, try to reframe it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Challenge yourself to try new things and step outside your comfort zone. When you encounter setbacks, reflect on what you can learn from the experience and how you can use that knowledge to improve.
2. Emphasize the process: Rather than focusing solely on outcomes, try to shift your attention to the process of learning and improvement. Celebrate small successes and milestones along the way, and reflect on what you did to achieve them. This can help you to build confidence and motivation, as well as to develop a growth-oriented mindset.
3. Seek out challenges: Rather than avoiding challenges or sticking with what you already know, challenge yourself to take on new and difficult tasks. Seek out opportunities to learn and grow, even if they are outside of your comfort zone. This can help you to develop new skills, gain new perspectives, and build resilience and adaptability.


## My Plan to Overcome These Challenges

1. I need to recognize when I'm exhibiting a fixed mindset. I need to acknowledge that I'm limiting myself and holding myself back with my beliefs.
2. I need to embrace challenges as an opportunity to learn and grow. Instead of shying away from challenges or being afraid of failure, I need to see them as a chance to improve myself and develop new skills.
3. I need to use positive self-talk to re-frame my mindset. Instead of saying "I can't do this," I should say "I haven't learned how to do this yet, but I can learn with practice."
4. I can take small steps to help me build momentum and confidence. I can break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks.
5. I should seek feedback from others to learn and improve. Constructive feedback can help me identify areas where I need to improve and give me direction on how to move forward.
6. I need to practice regularly to develop a growth mindset. I should make a commitment to practicing regularly, and be patient with myself. I should remember that progress is not always linear, and setbacks are a natural part of the learning process.
